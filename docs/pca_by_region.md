Principal component analysis on mutation spectrum, for all sequences or just sequences from specific geographic regions.
Each point represents a different clade.
The chart is interactive:

  - mouse over points for details
  - click on specific clades in the legend to highlight their points
  - clck on the "subset" legend to select only data from specific geographic regions
  - shift-click to make multiple selections

Note that the PCA itself is **not** re-calculated even when some points are de-selected for display.
