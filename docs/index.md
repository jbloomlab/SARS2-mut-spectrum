Interactive plots of the SARS-CoV-2 mutational spectrum, as estimated at 4-fold degenerate synonymous sites.
The plots are as following:

 - [Fractions and relative rates of different mutation types]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link rates-by-clade.md %})

 - [PCA of mutation spectra]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pca.md %})

 - [PCA of mutation spectra by geographic region]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pca_by_region.md %})

 - [PCA of mutation spectra excluding top mutations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pca_exclude_top.md %})
 
 - [PCA of mutation spectra with partitioned genome]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pca_partitioned.md %})

Note that the GitHub repository with the code and the processed data is at [https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2-mut-spectrum](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS2-mut-spectrum)

These plots accompany the paper ["Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 mutational spectrum" by Bloom, Beichman, Neher, & Harris](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.19.517207v1).
